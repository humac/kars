# Consolidated workflow that runs frontend and backend tests with path filtering
# Triggers conservatively to save runner minutes:
# - All PRs (to catch issues before merge)
# - Pushes to main and develop only when code changes
# - Manual runs via workflow_dispatch

on:
  pull_request:
    # Run on all PRs regardless of files changed
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop

      # Only run on push when these paths change
      - 'frontend/**'
      - 'backend/**'
