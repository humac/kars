## Admin Overview

As an administrator, you have full access to all system features and settings. The admin role includes exclusive access to:

- **User Management** - Add, edit, and remove users; change roles
- **Company Management** - Full CRUD operations on companies
- **Complete Audit Logs** - View all system activity
- **All Assets** - View and manage all registered assets
- **System Settings** - Configure application settings

### Admin Navigation

Admins see additional tabs in the navigation:
- **Company Management** (admin-only tab)
- **Admin Settings** (purple tab, admin-only)

## First Admin Setup

### Method 1: First User Automatic Promotion (Recommended)

The **very first user** to register automatically becomes an admin.

**Steps:**
1. Deploy the application
2. Navigate to the registration page
3. Register your account
4. You'll be automatically assigned the admin role
5. Login and access all admin features

**Console Output:**
```
Creating admin user: your-email@domain.com (first user)
```

### Method 2: Environment Variable

Set a specific email to always become admin upon registration.

**Steps:**
1. Edit your `.env` file (or set in Portainer)
2. Add: `ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin@domain.com`
3. Restart the backend service
4. Register with that email
5. You'll be assigned admin role

**Console Output:**
```
Creating admin user: your-admin@domain.com (admin email match)
```

### Method 3: Promote Existing User

If you're already an admin, promote another user:

1. Go to the **Users** page from the main navigation
2. Find the user in the table
3. Change their role dropdown to "Admin"
4. Role is updated immediately

## User Management

Access: **Users** page (main navigation - accessible to Managers and Admins)

**Managers** have read-only access to view user information, while **Admins** have full access to manage users.

### Viewing Users

The user table shows:
- **Name** - User's full name
- **Email** - User's email address
- **Role** - Current role (dropdown)
- **Created** - Account creation date
- **Last Login** - Last successful login
- **Actions** - Delete button

Total user count displayed at top right.

### Changing User Roles

**To change a user's role:**
1. Locate user in the table
2. Click the **Role** dropdown
3. Select new role:
   - Employee (default)
   - Manager
   - Admin
4. Change is saved automatically

**Restrictions:**
- Cannot change your own role
- Your role dropdown is disabled
- Prevents accidental self-demotion

**Role Capabilities:**

**Employee**

### Automatic Manager Role Assignment

- When users register or update their profile with a **manager email** matching an existing account, that person is automatically promoted to **Manager** (unless already Manager/Admin).
- If a newly registered user already has employees pointing to their email as manager, their role is automatically promoted to **Manager**.
- All auto-promotions are logged in the audit trail so admins can review and adjust roles if needed.

### Deleting Users

**To delete a user:**
1. Find user in the table
2. Click the **Delete** button (red)
3. Confirm the deletion
4. User is permanently removed

## Security Best Practices

### User Access Reviews

**Quarterly Tasks:**
1. Review **User Management** table
2. Check for:
   - Inactive users (old last login)
   - Terminated employees
   - Incorrect role assignments
3. Remove or update as needed
4. Document changes

### Role Management

**Guidelines:**
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Assign minimum necessary role
- **Regular Reviews:** Audit roles quarterly
- **Manager Promotion:** Verify before promoting to manager
- **Admin Restrictions:** Limit admin count to 2-3 trusted users
- **Document Changes:** Keep record of role modifications

### Password Security

**Recommendations:**
- Enforce strong passwords (current minimum: 6 characters)
- Consider implementing:
  - Password complexity requirements
  - Regular password rotation
  - Multi-factor authentication (future enhancement)

**Current implementation:**
- bcrypt hashing (10 rounds)
- Passwords never stored in plain text
- Password confirmation on registration

### JWT Secret Management

**Critical:**
- Use strong, random JWT_SECRET
- Minimum 64 characters recommended
- Never commit to version control
- Rotate periodically (requires all users to re-login)

**Generate strong secret:**
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```

**Update in Portainer:**
1. Go to stack environment variables
2. Update `JWT_SECRET`
3. Redeploy stack
4. All users must login again

### Audit Log Review

**Monthly Tasks:**
1. Export full audit logs
2. Review for:
   - Unusual activity patterns
   - Failed login attempts (future)
   - Bulk deletions
   - Off-hours activity
3. Investigate anomalies
4. Document findings

### System Updates

**Stay current:**
- Monitor GitHub for updates
- Review changelogs
- Test in staging first
- Schedule maintenance windows
- Backup before updating

## Backup & Maintenance

### Database Backups

**Manual Backup:**
```bash
# Create backup
docker run --rm \
  -v asset-data:/data \
  -v $(pwd):/backup \
  alpine tar czf /backup/asset-data-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz -C /data .
```

**Automated Backups:**
Schedule via cron:
```bash
# Daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /backup/location && docker run --rm -v asset-data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar czf /backup/asset-data-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).tar.gz -C /data .
```

**Backup Retention:**
- Daily backups: Keep 7 days
- Weekly backups: Keep 4 weeks
- Monthly backups: Keep 12 months

### Restore Database

**From backup:**
```bash
# Stop containers
docker-compose down

# Restore data
docker run --rm \
  -v asset-data:/data \
  -v $(pwd):/backup \
